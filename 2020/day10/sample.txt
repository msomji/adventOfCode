With these adapters, your device's built-in joltage adapter would be rated for 19 + 3 = 22 jolts, 3 higher than the highest-rated adapter.

Because adapters can only connect to a source 1-3 jolts lower than its rating, in order to use every adapter, you'd need to choose them like this:

The charging outlet has an effective rating of 0 jolts, so the only adapters that could connect to it directly would need to have a joltage rating of 1, 2, or 3 jolts. Of these, only one you have is an adapter rated 1 jolt (difference of 1).
From your 1-jolt rated adapter, the only choice is your 4-jolt rated adapter (difference of 3).
From the 4-jolt rated adapter, the adapters rated 5, 6, or 7 are valid choices. However, in order to not skip any adapters, you have to pick the adapter rated 5 jolts (difference of 1).
Similarly, the next choices would need to be the adapter rated 6 and then the adapter rated 7 (with difference of 1 and 1).
The only adapter that works with the 7-jolt rated adapter is the one rated 10 jolts (difference of 3).
From 10, the choices are 11 or 12; choose 11 (difference of 1) and then 12 (difference of 1).
After 12, only valid adapter has a rating of 15 (difference of 3), then 16 (difference of 1), then 19 (difference of 3).
Finally, your device's built-in adapter is always 3 higher than the highest adapter, so its rating is 22 jolts (always a difference of 3).
In this example, when using every adapter, there are 7 differences of 1 jolt and 5 differences of 3 jolts.
